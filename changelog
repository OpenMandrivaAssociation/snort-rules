snort (2.7.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Introduce all the rules available from the 2.4 release which are GPL and
    are non-VRT certified, that is, all rules which are outside of the range
    [3,465-1,000,000]. This amounts to a total of 3935 rules (820 of which are
    Community released).
  * In order to handle rulesets with mixed GPL and non-GPL rules two scripts
    have been made available in the source rules/ subdirectory:
        - remove-non-gpl.pl - Given a rules file removes all rules outside
          the above range
        - purge-non-gpl.sh - Given a directory dumps on the local directory
          only rules outside this range.
    In order to limit maintainer overhead the header for modified rulesets has
    not been changed.
  * Include the VRT license file. This file is kept for reference under the
    rules/ dir, although *no* rule in this package is under that non-free license.
